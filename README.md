# Analogic-Clock
This is a ticking clock made in java using java Graphics, I used an execution thread in order to implement the noises and double buffering.

Every second makes the famous ticking noise, every hour makes a bell noise, at midnight makes the clock tower noise from the video game "The legend of zelda, Majora's mask" and at noon makes the famous clock chimes noise from the "Big ben" tower which is located in London.
